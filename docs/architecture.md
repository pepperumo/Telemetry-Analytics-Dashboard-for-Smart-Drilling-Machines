# Telemetry Analytics Dashboard for Smart Drilling Machines Brownfield Enhancement Architecture

## Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing **Telemetry Analytics Dashboard for Smart Drilling Machines** with **ML/AI Predictive Maintenance capabilities**. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing project architecture by defining how new ML components will integrate with current FastAPI backend and React frontend systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing predictive analytics enhancements.

### Existing Project Analysis

**Current Project State:**
- **Primary Purpose:** Real-time telemetry analytics dashboard for drilling machine operations with KPI tracking, session monitoring, and anomaly detection
- **Current Tech Stack:** FastAPI 0.104+ backend, React 19.1.1 frontend with TypeScript, Pandas 2.0+ for data processing, Recharts for visualization
- **Architecture Style:** Service-oriented with clear separation between data processing, API layer, and frontend components
- **Deployment Method:** Local development with batch scripts (start-backend.bat/sh), structured for production scaling

**Available Documentation:**
- Comprehensive PRD for Advanced Analytics Engine enhancement
- Epic documentation with 5 detailed user stories
- Project brief documenting existing MVP functionality

## Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

### Enhancement Overview

**Enhancement Type:** Brownfield ML/AI Integration
**Scope:** Predictive maintenance capabilities with 5-story implementation (ML pipeline → Health scoring → Predictive alerts → Dashboard integration → Model management)
**Integration Impact:** Additive enhancement with zero disruption to existing functionality

### Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** 
- New `backend/app/ml/` module structure following existing service patterns
- Extension of existing `data_processor.py` rather than replacement
- Async background processing to isolate ML operations from existing workflows
- Feature flag architecture for safe rollback capabilities

**Database Integration:** 
- Initially file-based storage (JSON/CSV) consistent with current CSV processing approach
- ML feature store as structured files alongside existing telemetry data
- Phase 2 database migration planned without disrupting current file-based operations

**API Integration:** 
- New `/api/ml/*` namespace preserving existing `/api/dashboard/*` endpoints
- Consistent FastAPI patterns matching current endpoint structure
- Same authentication/authorization mechanisms as existing APIs
- Response schemas following established Pydantic model patterns

**UI Integration:** 
- Extension of existing React dashboard components rather than replacement
- New ML sections integrated into current navigation structure
- Consistent TailwindCSS styling and Recharts visualization patterns
- Progressive enhancement allowing existing dashboard to function independently

### Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** 100% backward compatibility for all `/api/dashboard/*` endpoints with identical response formats
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** No modifications to existing data processing; ML features stored separately with clear separation
- **UI/UX Consistency:** ML components follow existing design system, color schemes, and interaction patterns established in current dashboard
- **Performance Impact:** ML processing isolated through background tasks; existing dashboard load time maintained under 3 seconds
