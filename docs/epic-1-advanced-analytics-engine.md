# Epic: Advanced Analytics Engine - Brownfield Enhancement

**Epic ID**: EPIC-001  
**Created**: August 26, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Development  
**Priority**: High  

## Epic Goal

Transform the Telemetry Analytics Dashboard from reactive monitoring to proactive predictive maintenance by implementing ML/AI capabilities that forecast equipment failures and provide intelligent operational insights, while maintaining all existing MVP functionality and performance characteristics.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current Relevant Functionality:**
- Processes CSV telemetry data from drilling machine Pods (100+ sessions, 30-second intervals)
- Derives operational states from current consumption patterns (OFF/STANDBY/SPINNING/DRILLING)
- Provides real-time dashboard with KPIs, charts, maps, and anomaly detection
- Tracks Smart Tag compliance and battery health monitoring

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: FastAPI 0.104+ with Python 3.11+, Pandas 2.0+, NumPy 1.24+
- Frontend: React 19.1.1 with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Recharts, Leaflet
- Data: CSV file processing with structured telemetry analysis

**Integration Points:**
- Data processing pipeline in `backend/app/services/data_processor.py`
- REST API endpoints in `backend/app/api/dashboard.py`
- React dashboard components in `frontend/src/components/`
- Telemetry data flow from CSV → Processing → API → Dashboard

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Added:**
- ML data pipeline for feature engineering from existing telemetry data
- Predictive maintenance algorithms for equipment health scoring
- Intelligent alerting system with 48-72 hour advance warnings
- Pattern recognition capabilities for operational optimization
- ML-powered dashboard components integrated with existing UI

**How It Integrates:**
- New ML module under `backend/app/ml/` with models, preprocessing, and prediction services
- Additional API endpoints under `/api/ml/` namespace for predictive insights
- Extended React dashboard with new ML visualization components
- Background ML processing that doesn't impact existing CSV processing performance

**Success Criteria:**
- 75% minimum accuracy in equipment failure prediction
- ML processing completes within 30 seconds for 100-session dataset
- Zero impact on existing dashboard load times (<3 seconds)
- All existing MVP functionality remains fully operational

## Stories

### Story 1: ML Data Pipeline Foundation
Implement feature engineering pipeline that processes existing CSV telemetry data for ML analysis without disrupting current analytics functionality.

### Story 2: Equipment Health Scoring Model
Develop ML model that analyzes telemetry patterns to generate equipment health scores (0-100) with confidence intervals and explanatory factors.

### Story 3: Predictive Maintenance Alerts
Create intelligent alerting system that generates maintenance predictions 48-72 hours in advance with severity levels and recommended actions.

### Story 4: Pattern Recognition Dashboard
Integrate ML insights into existing React dashboard with health trend charts, maintenance timelines, and operational optimization recommendations.

### Story 5: ML Model Management and Optimization
Establish ML model versioning, performance monitoring, automated retraining, and management interface for production operations.

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ All existing REST API endpoints (`/api/dashboard/*`) remain unchanged and backward-compatible
- ✅ Current CSV data processing pipeline enhanced (not replaced) to support ML feature engineering
- ✅ Existing React dashboard components continue functioning while being extended with ML visualizations
- ✅ Database schema (future Phase 2) designed to accommodate both current telemetry and ML metadata
- ✅ Performance characteristics maintained: dashboard loads <3 seconds, CSV processing <3 seconds

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** ML processing could impact existing system performance or introduce dependency conflicts

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- ML processing runs as background services with result caching
- Modular ML architecture allows selective enabling/disabling of features
- All ML dependencies isolated in separate virtual environment/container
- Comprehensive integration testing validates existing functionality integrity

**Rollback Plan:**
- ML module designed as additive enhancement with feature flags
- Existing system functionality completely independent of ML components
- ML endpoints can be disabled without affecting core dashboard operations
- Database rollback plan for any schema changes in Phase 2

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All 5 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ ML predictions achieve minimum 75% accuracy on historical data validation
- ✅ Existing dashboard functionality verified through comprehensive regression testing
- ✅ ML API endpoints integrated and documented
- ✅ Performance benchmarks maintained (dashboard load time, CSV processing speed)
- ✅ ML model versioning and monitoring systems operational
- ✅ Documentation updated with ML architecture and operational procedures

## Technical Dependencies

**Required ML Libraries:**
- scikit-learn for model development and training
- joblib for model serialization and persistence
- Optional: TensorFlow Lite for advanced pattern recognition

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- ML model artifact storage (local filesystem initially, cloud storage Phase 2)
- Background task processing (FastAPI background tasks initially, Celery Phase 2)
- Model performance logging and monitoring integration

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**
- ML model accuracy: ≥75% for equipment failure prediction
- Processing performance: ML analysis completes within 30 seconds
- System reliability: Zero regression in existing functionality
- Integration success: All 5 stories deployed without rollback

**Business Metrics:**
- User adoption: Operations managers actively use predictive insights
- Operational impact: Early identification of maintenance needs
- System value: Enhanced decision-making through predictive analytics
