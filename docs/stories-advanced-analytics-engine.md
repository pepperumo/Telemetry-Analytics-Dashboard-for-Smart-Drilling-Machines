## Story 1.1: ML Data Pipeline Foundation

### User Story

As an **operations manager**,  
I want **the system to prepare historical telemetry data for machine learning analysis**,  
So that **we can build predictive models without disrupting current analytics functionality**.

### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: `backend/app/services/data_processor.py` (current CSV processing)
- Technology: FastAPI + Pandas + NumPy data processing pipeline
- Follows pattern: Existing service-based architecture with async processing
- Touch points: CSV data ingestion, telemetry data validation, feature extraction

**Current Data Flow:**
```
CSV Files → data_processor.py → REST API → Dashboard Components
```

**Enhanced Data Flow:**
```
CSV Files → data_processor.py → ML Feature Engineering → REST API → Dashboard
                              ↓
                           ML Feature Store
```

### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**: System extracts ML features from existing CSV telemetry data including:
   - Current consumption pattern features (mean, std, trend, change points)
   - Battery degradation features (charge/discharge rates, capacity trends)
   - Session operation features (duration, state transitions, efficiency metrics)
   - Temporal features (time-of-day patterns, session frequency)

2. **Data Quality Validation**: ML preprocessing validates data quality and handles:
   - Missing telemetry values through interpolation or flagging
   - Anomalous readings outside expected operational ranges
   - Sequence number gaps and their impact on feature reliability
   - GPS coordinate validation and jitter normalization

3. **Feature Store Structure**: Feature storage supports both analytics and ML:
   - Features stored in structured format (initially JSON/CSV, future database)
   - Metadata tracking for feature versioning and lineage
   - Efficient retrieval for both model training and inference
   - Clear separation between raw telemetry and engineered features

**Integration Requirements:**

4. **Existing Functionality Preservation**: Current CSV processing in `data_processor.py` continues unchanged with same performance characteristics

5. **Performance Maintenance**: ML feature engineering runs as background process without impacting:
   - Dashboard load times (maintain <3 seconds)
   - API response times for existing endpoints
   - CSV processing speed for 100-session dataset

6. **API Compatibility**: All existing `/api/dashboard/*` endpoints remain functional with identical response formats

**Quality Requirements:**

7. **Comprehensive Testing**: ML pipeline covered by:
   - Unit tests for feature engineering functions
   - Integration tests with existing data processing
   - Performance tests validating no regression in existing functionality

8. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when:
   - ML feature engineering fails (existing analytics continue)
   - Invalid data encountered during feature extraction
   - Resource constraints limit ML processing

9. **Documentation**: Updated technical documentation includes:
   - ML feature engineering pipeline architecture
   - Feature definitions and calculation methods
   - Integration points with existing data processing

### Technical Implementation Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Create new `backend/app/ml/preprocessing/` module for feature engineering
- Extend `data_processor.py` to call ML preprocessing after existing processing
- Use existing Pandas/NumPy infrastructure for feature calculations
- Implement async background processing to avoid blocking current operations

**Feature Engineering Strategy:**
- **Time Series Features**: Rolling windows, trends, seasonal patterns
- **Operational State Features**: Transition frequencies, state durations, efficiency metrics
- **Equipment Health Features**: Battery degradation rates, current consumption anomalies
- **Contextual Features**: GPS-based operational patterns, Smart Tag usage correlations

**Data Storage Pattern:**
```python
# Follow existing service pattern
class MLFeatureService:
    def __init__(self, data_processor: DataProcessor):
        self.data_processor = data_processor
    
    async def extract_features(self, telemetry_data: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Feature engineering logic
        pass
```

   - Health scoring failures don't impact existing dashboard functionality
   - Model loading errors result in graceful fallback (e.g., "Health scoring unavailable")
   - Invalid feature data handled with appropriate error messages and logging

9. **Model Versioning**: Health scoring model prepared for production lifecycle:
   - Model artifacts stored with version information and metadata
   - Model loading supports fallback to previous version if new model fails
   - Training data and model performance metrics logged for audit trail

### Technical Implementation Notes

**Model Development Approach:**
- **Algorithm**: Start with Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for interpretability
- **Features**: Use engineered features from Story 1.1 (consumption patterns, battery trends, operational efficiency)
- **Training Strategy**: Unsupervised/semi-supervised initially, evolving to supervised with maintenance event labels

        self.feature_service = feature_service
        self.model = self._load_model()
    
    async def calculate_health_scores(self, device_ids: List[str]) -> Dict[str, HealthScore]:
        # Health scoring logic
        pass
```

**API Endpoint Design:**
```python
# New endpoint in ml.py
@router.get("/health-scores")
async def get_health_scores(
    device_ids: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    include_trends: bool = False
) -> List[HealthScoreResponse]:
    # Health score retrieval logic
    pass
```

```
Health Scores → Predictive Alert Engine → Maintenance Alerts (48-72h advance)
                                      ↓
                               Alert Prioritization + Recommended Actions
```

### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

2. **Intelligent Alert Filtering**: Alert system minimizes false positives while maintaining sensitivity:
   - Algorithm analyzes health score trends over time rather than single-point thresholds
   - Alert suppression for known operational patterns (e.g., expected battery drain during intensive drilling)
   - Alert escalation logic increases severity when conditions deteriorate despite initial warnings
   - Historical alert accuracy tracking to improve prediction algorithms over time

3. **Actionable Alert Content**: Alerts provide specific, actionable guidance:

   - Alert processing runs as background task with minimal resource consumption
   - Alert generation completes within 5 seconds for full equipment fleet
   - Alert system failures don't affect existing dashboard or anomaly detection functionality

**Quality Requirements:**

7. **Alert Accuracy and Validation**: Predictive alerts demonstrate value through accuracy metrics:
   - Alert accuracy target: 75% of alerts correspond to actual maintenance needs within predicted timeframe
   - False positive rate: <25% of alerts prove unnecessary upon investigation
   - Alert effectiveness measured through correlation with subsequent maintenance events
   - Alert threshold tuning based on operational feedback and historical validation

8. **Alert Management and Usability**: Alert system provides effective operational support:
   - Alert prioritization helps operations managers focus on most critical equipment
   - Alert acknowledgment and feedback mechanisms allow system learning and improvement
   - Alert history and trends available for operational planning and pattern analysis
   - Clear escalation paths when predicted issues become critical

9. **System Resilience**: Alert system operates reliably in production environment:
   - Alert generation continues even if individual health scoring models fail
   - Alert delivery has fallback mechanisms if primary notification systems are unavailable
   - Alert data persistency ensures no loss of critical maintenance predictions
   - Alert system monitoring and health checks integrated with existing system monitoring

### Technical Implementation Notes

```python
class PredictiveAlertEngine:
    def __init__(self, health_service: HealthScoringService):
        self.health_service = health_service
        self.alert_thresholds = self._load_alert_config()
    
    async def generate_alerts(self) -> List[MaintenanceAlert]:
        # Predictive alert generation logic
        pass
    
    def _analyze_health_trends(self, health_history: List[HealthScore]) -> AlertRisk:
        # Trend analysis for alert triggers
        pass
```

**Alert Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Health Score Analysis**: Analyze current and historical health scores for trend patterns
2. **Risk Assessment**: Calculate probability and timeframe of maintenance needs
3. **Alert Generation**: Create alerts with severity, recommendations, and timeframes
4. **Alert Filtering**: Apply intelligent filtering to reduce false positives
5. **Alert Delivery**: Send alerts through existing notification infrastructure

**Alert Data Model:**
```python
class MaintenanceAlert(BaseModel):
    alert_id: str
    device_id: str
    severity: AlertSeverity  # LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
    predicted_issue_type: str
    predicted_timeframe: str  # "48-72 hours"
    confidence: float
    recommended_actions: List[str]
    health_score_trend: List[float]
