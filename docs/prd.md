## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis combined with comprehensive project brief created by Business Analyst Mary

**Current Project State**: 
The Telemetry Analytics Dashboard successfully processes IoT telemetry data from smart drilling machine "Pods" and transforms it into operational insights. The system currently handles CSV-based telemetry processing (30-second intervals), operating state derivation (OFF/STANDBY/SPINNING/DRILLING based on current consumption), Smart Tag compliance tracking via BLE ID detection, geographic mapping of drilling sessions (Berlin area), battery health monitoring and anomaly detection, and comprehensive web dashboard with charts, KPIs, and interactive maps.

### Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**: ✅
- ✅ Project Brief (comprehensive analysis by Business Analyst Mary)
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (FastAPI + React 19 + TypeScript)
- ✅ API Documentation (REST endpoints for telemetry data)
- ✅ Current Architecture (monorepo with backend/frontend separation)
- ✅ MVP Feature Requirements (all 7 core features implemented)
- ⚠️ ML/AI Documentation (to be created as part of this enhancement)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ Advanced Analytics Engine - ML/AI capabilities for predictive maintenance

**Enhancement Description**: 
Implement machine learning and AI capabilities to transform the current reactive analytics into predictive intelligence. This enhancement will add pattern recognition, predictive maintenance algorithms, and intelligent alerts that can forecast equipment issues before they occur, optimizing drilling operations through data-driven predictions.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes) - New ML pipeline, enhanced data processing, extended API endpoints, and expanded dashboard capabilities

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Implement predictive maintenance algorithms to forecast equipment failures before they occur
- Add pattern recognition to identify optimal drilling parameters and operational efficiency opportunities  
- Create intelligent alerting system that learns from historical patterns and anomalies
- Develop trend analysis and forecasting capabilities for operational planning
- Establish foundation for autonomous operational recommendations

**Background Context**:
The current system provides excellent real-time and historical visibility into drilling operations, but operates reactively - identifying issues after they've occurred. With 100+ drilling sessions of rich telemetry data (current consumption, GPS, battery, Smart Tag usage), we now have sufficient data foundation to implement predictive analytics. This enhancement will transform the platform from a monitoring tool into an intelligent operational assistant that can prevent problems and optimize performance proactively.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system shall implement predictive maintenance algorithms that analyze historical current consumption patterns, battery degradation trends, and operational states to forecast potential equipment failures with 48-72 hour advance warning

**FR2**: The system shall provide pattern recognition capabilities that identify optimal drilling parameters by analyzing correlation between current consumption patterns, session duration, and operational efficiency metrics

**FR3**: The system shall implement intelligent anomaly detection that learns from historical data patterns and reduces false positives by distinguishing between normal operational variations and genuine equipment issues

**FR4**: The system shall generate predictive insights dashboard showing equipment health scores, predicted maintenance windows, and operational optimization recommendations based on ML analysis

**FR5**: The system shall maintain all existing MVP functionality (drilling time tracking, session analysis, Smart Tag compliance, battery monitoring, geographic mapping) while adding predictive capabilities

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: ML processing shall not impact existing dashboard performance - predictive analytics shall run as background processes with results cached and updated incrementally

**NFR2**: The system shall support training ML models on historical data while maintaining data privacy and not exposing sensitive operational information

**NFR3**: Predictive algorithms shall achieve minimum 75% accuracy in equipment failure prediction when validated against historical data patterns

**NFR4**: ML model training and inference shall be designed to scale efficiently as dataset grows beyond current 100-session baseline

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: All existing REST API endpoints must remain functional and backward-compatible while adding new ML-specific endpoints for predictive insights

**CR2**: Current CSV data processing pipeline must be preserved and enhanced (not replaced) to support both existing analytics and new ML feature engineering

**CR3**: Existing React dashboard components must continue to function while being extended with new predictive analytics visualizations

**CR4**: Database schema (when implemented in Phase 2) must accommodate both current telemetry storage and new ML model metadata/predictions storage
