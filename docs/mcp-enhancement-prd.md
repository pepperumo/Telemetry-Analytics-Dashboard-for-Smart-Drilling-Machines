### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration - Enable AI agent access to telemetry data and ML insights

**Enhancement Description**: 
Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) server capabilities to expose telemetry data, ML insights, and predictive maintenance information to AI agents and external systems. This enhancement will add MCP server infrastructure, standardized tool interfaces for telemetry queries, ML data access protocols, and integration with existing API endpoints while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Moderate Impact (new modules with minimal existing code changes) - New MCP server module, additional API layer, tool definitions, with minimal changes to existing telemetry and ML services

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:

- Establish foundation for AI-driven operational insights and recommendations
- Maintain full compatibility with existing REST API and dashboard functionality

**Background Context**:
With the successful implementation of ML capabilities and comprehensive telemetry analytics, the system now contains valuable operational data and insights that could benefit external AI agents and automation systems. MCP integration will enable standardized access to this data, allowing AI agents to provide intelligent recommendations, automated reporting, and enhanced decision support for drilling operations.

**CR2**: Current telemetry and ML data processing pipelines must continue unchanged while being accessible through MCP tools

**CR3**: Existing React dashboard functionality must be preserved during MCP server integration

**CR4**: MCP server must integrate with existing authentication and security mechanisms

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.11+ (backend), TypeScript (frontend), JavaScript (build tools)
**Frameworks**: FastAPI 0.104+ with Uvicorn, React 19.1.1 with Vite 7.1.2
**Data Processing**: Pandas 2.0+, NumPy 1.24+ for telemetry analysis, ML pipeline with scikit-learn

**ML Stack**: Random Forest models, feature engineering pipeline, health scoring algorithms
**Infrastructure**: File-based CSV processing, ML model artifacts, containerization-ready

### Integration Approach

**MCP Server Integration Strategy**: 
- Implement MCP server as separate FastAPI module under `/mcp/` namespace
- Leverage existing telemetry and ML service layers for data access
- Use existing Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Maintain separation between MCP and REST API endpoints

**Data Access Integration Strategy**:
- MCP tools will access same data sources as existing REST endpoints
- Implement MCP-specific response formatting while using existing business logic
- Cache MCP responses using existing caching mechanisms
- Ensure data consistency between MCP and REST API responses

**Security Integration Strategy**:
- Integrate MCP authentication with existing security framework
- Implement MCP-specific access controls for different tool categories
- Use existing logging and monitoring infrastructure for MCP operations
- Maintain audit trails for MCP tool usage

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
```
backend/
  app/
    mcp/                    # New MCP module
      __init__.py
      server.py            # MCP server implementation
      tools.py             # MCP tool definitions
      handlers.py          # MCP request handlers
      auth.py              # MCP authentication
    api/
      mcp.py               # MCP management endpoints (optional)
    services/
      mcp_service.py       # MCP data service layer
```

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing Python PEP8 conventions, MCP-specific prefixes (mcp_, tool_)
**Coding Standards**: Maintain existing FastAPI + Pydantic patterns, add MCP-specific documentation standards
**Documentation Standards**: Extend existing Google-style docstrings with MCP tool documentation requirements

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Extend existing backend build to include MCP server components
**Deployment Strategy**: Container-based deployment with MCP server as part of main application
**Configuration Management**: Add MCP-specific environment variables for server settings, authentication, and tool configurations
**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing logging with MCP connection metrics, tool usage tracking, and performance monitoring

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale - The MCP Enhancement represents a cohesive set of capabilities that work together to provide AI agent access to telemetry and ML data. While technically modular, all components (server infrastructure, tool definitions, authentication, data access) are interdependent and should be delivered as a unified enhancement to maintain protocol consistency and minimize integration complexity.

This approach ensures:
- Consistent MCP implementation across all tool categories
- Unified authentication and security model for AI agent access
- Coordinated integration with existing data services
- Simplified testing and validation of end-to-end MCP workflow
